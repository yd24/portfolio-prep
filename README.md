1. Aspiring technology wizard.

2. Building beautiful and useful tools for all to use.

3. Hi, my name is Daniel and Iâ€™m currently a Software Developer specializing in web applications. I build useful and visually appealing tools using modern Javascript libraries such as React. Previously, I used to work in roles involving logistics and retail. Working with clients and teams across different businesses has helped me gain a sense of the kind of needs and expectations that users have for different industries and platforms. This has also made me excited to work on projects that are larger in scale and have a strong impact on the world. 

4. I love that tech allows people to become craftsmen without physical barriers. A piece of technology can be used by anyone and everyone, all across the world.
